## Get the Terra core source code

Use `git` to retrieve [Terra core](https://github.com/terra-money/core/), and checkout the `master` branch, which contains the latest stable release.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terra-money/core
cd core
git checkout master
```

## Build Terra core from source

Build Terra core, and install the `terrad` executable to your `GOPATH` environment variable.

```bash
