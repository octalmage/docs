If this is your first time using Terra Station, follow the [Terra Station tutorial](../download/terra-station-desktop.md).

## Stake Luna

Stake your Luna to a validator to start earning rewards. Before you stake, make sure you have Luna in your wallet. You can transfer Luna from an [exchange](wallet.md) or [swap coins](wallet.md) you have for Luna.

1. Open Terra Station and click **Staking**.

2. Select a Validator and click on their name in the **Moniker** column of the validator list.

3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Delegate**. A new window will appear.

4. In the **Amount** field, specify the amount of Luna you want to delegate, and click **Next**.

   :::{admonition} Keep coins for fees
   :class: warning
   Always keep some coins to pay fees with. Never stake your entire wallet amount. Without money for fees, you can't make any transactions.
   :::

5. Double check the amounts and fees. Enter your password and click **Delegate**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake Luna. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Terra Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow these steps to withdraw them:

1. Open Terra Station and click **Staking**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards only from a single validator, click on their name in the list and click **withdraw** on their page.  A new window will appear.

3. Review the amounts and specify which coin you want to pay fees in.

4. Enter your password and click **withdraw**.

Congratulations, you've just withdrawn your staking rewards!

## Redelegate

Redelegating lets you transfer staked Luna from one validator to another without waiting the 21-day unstaking period. Redelegating happens instantly.

:::{warning}
When a user redelegates staked Luna from one validator to another, the validator receiving the staked Luna is barred from making further redelegation transactions for 21 days. This requirement only applies to the wallet that made the redelegation transaction.
:::

1. Open Terra Station and connect your wallet. Click **Staking**.

2. Click on the validator you want to redelegate to.

3. Under the **My delegations** section, click **Redelegate**.

4. Select the validator you would like to redelegate from.

5. Enter the amount of Luna you want to redelegate.

6. Confirm the amounts. Enter your password and click **Redelegate**.

Your staked Luna will be transferred to the new validator.

## Undelegate

Undelegate Luna to unstake it from a validator. The unstaking period takes 21 days to complete.

:::{warning}
Once started, the delegating or undelegating processes can't be stopped.
Undelegating takes 21 days to complete. The only way to undo a delegating or undelegating transaction is to wait for the unbonding process to pass. Alternatively, you can redelegate staked Luna to a different validator without waiting 21 days.
:::

1. Open Terra Station and connect your wallet. Click **Staking**.

2. Click on the validator you want to unstake from.

3. Click **Undelegate** under the **My delegations** section.

4. Enter the amount of Luna you want to undelegate. Click **Next**.

4. Confirm the amounts. Enter your password and click **Undelegate**.

Your staked Luna is unbonding. Please check back in 21 days to complete the process.
